# Codex UX Guardrails

Use these guardrails for every version:

1) Use the LicenseWatch UI kit components (PageHeader, SectionCard, KPI cards, EmptyState).
2) No dull pages. If a screen looks flat, redesign with hierarchy, cards, and spacing.
3) Follow the UI/UX Acceptance Checklist before shipping.
4) If unsure, start by clarifying the primary action and the decision-support flow.
